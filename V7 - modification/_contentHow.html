                The most effective way of dealing with stress is not finding the solution of your stress, 
                but rather recognize the cause and the response of your stress.

                  <h3>Recognize when you are stressed</h3> 
                  <br>
                  Sometimes it might seems obvious that you would know when you are stress, 
                  but there are also sometimes when we forget to adjust our nerve system to be balanced: 
                  when we are calm yet still alert and focused. <br>
                  <br>
                  Try to recognize the fact that you are stressed by observing your body reactions.
                  When you’re tired, your eyes feel heavy and you might rest your head on your hand. 
                  When you’re happy, you laugh easily. And when you’re stressed, your body lets you know that, too. 
                  Get in the habit of paying attention to your body’s clues. <br>
                  <br>
                  <hr>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Observe your muscles and insides: </strong> 
                  Are your muscles tense or sore? 
                  Is your stomach tight, cramped, or aching? 
                  Are your hands or jaw clenched? <br>
                  <br>
                  <strong>Observe your breath: </strong>
                  Is your breathing shallow? Place one hand on your belly, the other on your chest. 
                  Watch your hands rise and fall with each breath. 
                  Notice when you breathe fully or when you “forget” to breathe.

                Firstly, you need to identify which sensory experience works the best for you.
                This requires some experimentation. Look for inspirations around you, watch how others handle stress. 
                There is always a tool for you to relieve stress. 
                Think about what is the specific kind of sound or type of movement that affects you the most? <br>

              <br>
              <ul>
                
                <li><strong>Take a breath: </strong>
                  breathing exercises help you to relax because they make your body feel like it does when you are already relaxed. 
                  Deep breathing is one of the best ways to lower stress because it sends a message to your brain to calm down and relax.</li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Exercise: </strong>:
                  Exercise and other physical activity produce endorphins—chemicals in the brain that act as natural painkillers and 
                  improve the ability to sleep, which in turn reduces stress.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Yoga: </strong>
                  Yoga promotes relaxation, which is the natural opposite of stress. 
                  Yoga can benefit three aspects of ourselves that are often affected by stress: our body, mind, and breathing.
                </li> 
                <br>
                <li><strong>Listen to soothing music: </strong>
                  As music can absorb our attention, it acts as a distraction at the same time it helps to explore emotions.
                  A slower tempo can quiet your mind and relax your muscles, making you feel soothed while releasing the stress of the day. </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Sleep: </strong>
                  Following a regular sleep routine calms and restores the body, improves concentration, regulates mood, and sharpens judgment and decision-making. 
                  You are a better problem solver and are better able to cope with stress when you’re well-rested. 
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Learn to avoid procrastination: </strong>
                  Following schedule and finish tasks on time instead of leaving everything until the end helps to prevent stress occuring at the first place.
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Reduce caffeine, alcohol intake and smoking: </strong>
                  Caffeine and alcohol excited your brain, prevent you from easily fall asleep. 
                  Smoking, on another hand, can help you release stress in a short term. 
                  However, it is easily to become independent on smoking which is harmful to your body in a long term. 
                </li>
                <br>
                <li><strong>Spend time with the close ones: </strong>
                  Just talk it out! Seek help and advise from others will make you feel more relieved. 
                </li>
